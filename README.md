# Musical-Notes-Conversion
This project's objective is to convert the piano musical notes into the flute notes. It also includes other features but before that I just want you to get clear that this project was created during my early learning phase in web development, using only basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any frameworks or modern tools. It is a simple, standalone website built using traditional methods, and the code structure is not optimized.
At the time, I found making the site responsive to be a significant challenge due to the inefficient code structure, which made layout adjustments quite difficult. As a result, I decided to leave the project as-is and not pursue further improvements.
That said, I'm sharing it because the core concept—converting piano notes to flute notations—is unique and uncommon, and I believe the idea itself is worth showcasing, even if the implementation remains basic.

# Some features of this website include:
- Converts Piano notes to Flute notes
- Conversion among different types of Flute notations [e.g. 2-hole Sa notation to 3-hole Sa notation and similary others]
- You can write the string of musical notes according to the instructions and then hit play button to listen that series of notes.
- You can play the virtual Piano with mouse and keyboard both.
