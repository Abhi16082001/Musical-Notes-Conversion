# Musical-Notes-Conversion
This project's objective is to convert the piano musical notes into the flute notes. It also includes other features but before that I just want you to get clear that It's just a very basic website created using very traditional method. I created it just for practice when I was learning Web development for the first time. So don't expect anything much from it, its just some HTML, CSS and JS files linked together nothing more than that. And I didn't want to improve it as I wasn't interested much in this project. But I am pushing it here because of the idea of this project, "Converting Piano Notes to Flute notes" is interesting and not common.

# Some features of this website include:
- Converts Piano notes to Flute notes
- Conversion among different types of Flute notations [e.g. 2-hole Sa notation to 3-hole Sa notation and similary others]
- You can write the string of musical notes according to the instructions and then hit play button to listen that series of notes.
- You can play the virtual Piano with mouse and keyboard both.
